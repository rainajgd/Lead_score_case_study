An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. There are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage but only a few of them come out as paying customers. 
The company needs to nurture the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc.) in order to get a higher lead conversion.
